# MySwitzerland üá®üá≠

MySwitzerland is my first SwiftUI iOS application. You can look at some emojis that represent some, for me, typical elements of Switzerland. And: You can even play some L√§ndler music in the background! üòÅ

## Features

- **Emoji Selection**: Users can choose between various Swiss-themed emojis including mountains, the Swiss flag, cheese, a party face, and hiking boots.
- **Music Playback**: Incorporates an audio player to enjoy traditional Swiss music while interacting with the app.
